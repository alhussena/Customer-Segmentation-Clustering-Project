Data Description
Dataset: The dataset used in this project includes customer demographic information, purchase history, and other behavioral metrics.
Features: Typical features might include age, gender, annual income, spending score, etc.
Source: Replace with the actual source of your dataset (e.g., company database, public datasets like Mall Customers, etc.).
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning the data by handling missing values and outliers.
Feature scaling to ensure all variables contribute equally to the distance metrics.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing distributions and relationships among variables.
Determining the potential number of clusters using methods like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis.
Clustering Algorithm:

Applying K-Means clustering to segment the customers.
Experimenting with different numbers of clusters to find the optimal segmentation.
Post-Clustering Analysis:

Interpreting the clusters to understand the characteristics of each segment.
Visualizing clusters with scatter plots and other visual tools to communicate insights.
